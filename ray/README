1. Your name and the name of your teammate (if any)

	Benjamin Xu:			Triangle intersection, Barycentric, Reflection, Refraction, Threads
	Supawit Chockchowwat:	Phong shading, Shadow tracing, Anti-aliasings

2. An explanation of any required features that you know are not working completely correctly, but would like to have considered for partial credit

	The refraction is brighter than what should be present. Most likely, this is due to some aspect of the distance spent inside an object that we mismeasured. There are also several black pixels in the dragon we are unsure of.

3. Anything the milestone-specific specs below ask you to include.

	Adaptive Anti-Aliasing:
		- to activate run "./ray --adaptaa" (the flag needs to be right after "./ray")
		- sampling by pseudorandom sampling (number at each level: samples^2)
		- have a parameter (adaa_eps) needs to be tuned


	Adaptive Termination
        once the size of a ray's contributions dips below a certain limit (for refraction and reflection rays only), they halt and return black as their color.

	Overlapping objects
		Assumes that "first" material is air. "First" is in quotes because it's a weird first. If the first intersection is opposite the surface normal, air is assumed to be outside. If the first intersection is on the same side as the surface normal, air is deemed to be inside.
        Assumptions are made about the nesting of objects.
